"What is the recommended dietary habit for patients with gastric ulcers?
1. Eating spicy foods
2. Regular meals
3. Fasting
4. Encouraging alcohol and smoking","Regular meals

Patients with gastric ulcers are advised to eat a normal diet, which implies having regular meals. This helps in managing the condition by avoiding long periods without food, which can increase stomach acid and potentially worsen the ulcer."
"Why can NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) cause gastric ulcers?
1. Because they promote digestion
2. Because they inhibit the production of prostaglandins that protect the gastric mucosa
3. Because they enhance immune function
4. Because they increase blood pressure","2. Because they inhibit the production of prostaglandins that protect the gastric mucosa

NSAIDs inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the gastric mucosa. Prostaglandins help protect the stomach lining by promoting the secretion of mucus and bicarbonate, which neutralize stomach acid and maintain mucosal blood flow. By inhibiting prostaglandin production, NSAIDs reduce these protective mechanisms, increasing the risk of gastric ulcers."
"What is the first thing to do when acute bleeding occurs in a gastric ulcer patient?
1. Provide intravenous fluids
2. Administer antibiotics
3. Surgery
4. Administer painkillers","1. Provide intravenous fluids

The first step in managing acute bleeding in a gastric ulcer patient is to provide immediate fluid resuscitation.
